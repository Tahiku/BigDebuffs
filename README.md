This version has combined the best components and features of the many BigDebuff-versions that I have encountered throughout the past few years (both from 3.3.5 & Classic)

### Features:
- CircleCooldownTemplate is implemented, thanks to Roman & BannZay


- Logically categorised spells
- Very extensive list of spellIds
- CompactRaidFrames compatability
- Blacklist unwanted Auras from CompactRaidFrames.
- Stance tracking on Warriors
- Recklessness & Retaliation stack text added to all frames but CompactRaidFrames.


## Additional & minor edits:
- Green stack text added for Auras
